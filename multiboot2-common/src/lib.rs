//! Common helpers for the `multiboot2` and `multiboot2-header` crates.
//!
//! # Value-add
//!
//! The main value-add of this crate is to abstract away the parsing and
//! construction of Multiboot2 structures. This is more complex as it may sound
//! at first due to the difficulties listed below.
//!
//! The abstractions provided by this crate serve as the base to work with the
//! following structures:
//! - multiboot2:
//!   - boot information structure (whole)
//!   - boot information tags
//! - multiboot2-header:
//!   - header structure (whole)
//!   - header tags
//!
//! # The Problem / Difficulties
//!
//! ## Multiboot2 Structures
//!
//! Multiboot2 structures are a consecutive chunk of bytes in memory. They use
//! the "header pattern", which means a fixed size and known [`Header`] type
//! indicates the total size of the structure. This is roughly translated to the
//! following rusty base type:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[repr(C, align(8))]
//! struct DynStructure {
//!     header: MyHeader,
//!     payload: [u8]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Note that these structures can also be nested. So for example, the
//! Multiboot2 boot information contains Multiboot2 tags, and the Multiboot2
//! header contains Multiboot2 header tags - both are itself dynamic structures.
//!
//! A final `[u8]` field in the structs is the most rusty way to model this.
//! However, this makes the type a Dynamically Sized Type (DST). To create
//! references to these types from a byte slice, one needs fat pointers. They
//! are a language feature currently not constructable with stable Rust.
//! Luckily, we can utilize [`ptr_meta`].
//!
//! ## Dynamic and Sized Structs
//!
//! Note that we also have structures (tags) in Multiboot2 that looks like this:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[repr(C, align(8))]
//! struct DynStructure {
//!     header: MyHeader,
//!     // Not just [`u8`]
//!     payload: [SomeType]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! or
//!
//! ```ignore
//! #[repr(C, align(8))]
//! struct CommandLineTag {
//!     header: TagHeader,
//!     start: u32,
//!     end: u32,
//!     // More than just the base header before the dynamic portion
//!     data: [u8]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! ## Fat Pointer Requirements
//!
//! To create fat pointers with [`ptr_meta`], each tag needs a `Metadata` type
//! which is either `usize` (for DSTs) or `()`. A trait is needed to abstract
//! above sized or unsized types.
//!
//! ## Multiboot2 Requirements
//!
//! All tags must be 8-byte aligned. Space between multiple tags may be
//! filled with zeroes if necessary. These zeroes are not reflected in the
//! previous tag's size.
//!
//! ## Rustc Requirements
//!
//! The allocation space that Rust requires for types is a multiple of the
//! alignment. This means that if we cast between byte slices and specific
//! types, Rust doesn't just see the size reported by the header but also
//! any necessary padding bytes. If this is not the case, for example we
//! cast to a structure from a `&[u8; 15]`, Miri will complain as it expects
//! `&[u8; 16]`
//!
//! See <https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/type-layout.html> for information.
//!
//! # Provided Abstractions
//!
//! ## Parsing and Casting
//!
//! First, we need byte slices which are guaranteed to be aligned and are a
//! multiple of the alignment. We have [`BytesRef`] for that. With that, we can
//! create a [`DynSizedStructure`]. This is a rusty type that owns all the bytes
//! it owns, according to the size reported by its header. Using this type
//! and with the help of [`MaybeDynSized`], we can call
//! [`DynSizedStructure::cast`] to cast this to arbitrary sized or unsized
//! struct types fulfilling the corresponding requirements.
//!
//! This way, one can create nice rusty structs modeling the structure of the
//! tags, and we only need a single "complicated" type, namely
//! [`DynSizedStructure`].
//!
//! ## Iterating Tags
//!
//! To iterate over the tags of a structure, use [`TagIter`].
//!
//! # Memory Guarantees and Safety Promises
//!
//! For the parsing and construction of Multiboot2 structures, the alignment
//! and necessary padding bytes as discussed above are guaranteed. When types
//! are constructed, they return Results with appropriate error types. If
//! during runtime something goes wrong, for example due to malformed tags,
//! panics guarantee that no UB will happen.
//!
//! # No Public API
//!
//! Not meant as stable public API for others outside Multiboot2.
